# Evaluation of Postfix Expression

Given a postfix expression, the task is to evaluate the postfix expression.

Postfix expression: The expression of the form “a b operator” (ab+) i.e., when a pair of operands is followed by an operator.

Examples:
```
Input: str = “2 3 1 * + 9 -“
Output: -4
Explanation: If the expression is converted into an infix expression, it will be 2 + (3 * 1) – 9 = 5 – 9 = -4.
```
```
Input: str = “100 200 + 2 / 5 * 7 +”
Output: 75
