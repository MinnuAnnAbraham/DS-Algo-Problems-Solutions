# Find Kth Minimum Vulnerability

Amazon Web Services has n servers where the ith server's vulnerability score is vulnerability[i]. A client wants to deploy their application on a group of m contiguous servers. The vulnerability of a group is defined as the kth minimum vulnerability among the chosen servers. Find the vulnerability of each possible group of m contiguous servers the client can choose.

Function Description

Complete the function findKthMinimumVulnerability in the editor below.

findKthMinimumVulnerability has the following parameter(s):

int k: the order of the vulnerability to find
int m: the number of servers in a group
int vulnerability[n]: the vulnerabilities of each server
Returns

int[]: the vulnerabilities for each group, in order

Example 1:
```
Input:  k = 2, m = 3, vulnerability = [1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [2, 2] 
Explanation:

There are 2 contiguous groups of m = 3 servers: [1, 3, 2] and [3, 2, 1].

The k = 2nd lowest vulnerability in each group is 2.

Return the answers for each group, in order: [2, 2].
```
Example 2:
```
Input:  k = 3, m = 4, vulnerability = [4, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Output: [3, 2] 
```

      
Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 3*105 
- 1 <= vulnerability[i] <= 109
